# Checkers

The program is a classic checkers game with three modes of play:

**- single-player against a computer opponent**

**- two-player game on one computer**

**- two-player game over a socket-based server**

# Setings
If the menu background is not loading, you need to change the path in the MENU class. If you want to change the game duration or the color of the pawn that makes the first move, you can do so in the Game class.

# Compile

To turn on the program you should start main class in any IDE that supports GUI.
The program was writing in the Intellij IDE so I recommend it to use while trying the program.
